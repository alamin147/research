Hypothesis: Build a better system by using Machine
Learning and Image Processing to detect and classify diseases of
the rice plant.

Gap:
Finding:

Method: There are four method used here.They removed image background. Then K-means clustering for centroid feeding. Then they removed green pixels in disease portion using thresholding technique. And finally Support vector Machine (SVM) for multi classification. Then they used 5 and 10 fold cross validation for more precise accuracy.


result: They got 83.80% on training dataset and 88.57% on test dataset.
